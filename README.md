This is a tracing facility for eBPF that produces rich, event-based diagnostic information. It efficiently copies tracing events into user space using a ring buffer, and emits them conveniently using the [tracing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing) facility. 

> [!WARNING]
> This crate has been integrated into [xbpf](https://crates.io/crates/xbpf). Please use xbpf for continued support with new features and bug fixes.

## Usage

You can run the example using `RUST_LOG=trace cargo r --bin example` 

To use `bpf-tracing`, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
bpf-tracing = "0.0.4"

[build-dependencies]
bpf-tracing-include = "0.0.4"
```

Next, in your `build.rs` script, provide the `bpf_tracing_include` arguments to clang as follows:
```rust
let mut args = vec![OsString::from("-I"), OsString::from("../include")];
args.extend(bpf_tracing_include::clang_args_from_default_env(true).unwrap());

SkeletonBuilder::new()
    .source(&src)
    .clang_args(args)
    .build_and_generate(&out)
    .unwrap();
```
`clang_args_from_env` reads the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to compile out unneeded logging calls in the eBPF code. Note that `bpf-tracing` disables tracing at compile time, since logging is expensive in eBPF. Note that this example uses [libbpf-rs](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-rs), but other libraries work just as well.

In your eBPF program, you can now include the [bpf_tracing.h](include/bpf_tracing.h) header and call tracing functions.
```c
#include "bpf_tracing.h"

SEC("sockops")
int monitor_sockets(struct bpf_sock_ops *ops) {
    if (ops->op == BPF_SOCK_OPS_PASSIVE_ESTABLISHED_CB || ops->op == BPF_SOCK_OPS_ACTIVE_ESTABLISHED_CB) {
        bpf_start_info_span("sockops");

        bpf_info("Established socket %d", skey.local.port);

        bpf_end_span("sockops");
    }

    return SK_PASS;
}
```

Finally, in your Rust program, you'll have to enable `bpf-tracing`. It then starts reading the ring buffer and continuously emits the tracing events.
```rust
bpf_tracing::try_init()?;
```

This will yield the following trace:
```
